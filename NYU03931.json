  "description": "This table provides a list of historical U.S. newspapers that are available online at no cost. Newspapers available for free through Google News Historical Archives and Newspaperarchives.com are listed individually as I identify them. Newspapers available through Chronicling America and state digitization projects are usually listed as a group. For instance, under 'Wyoming' I have not listed every newspaper digitized in the project but simply described what is available.",
