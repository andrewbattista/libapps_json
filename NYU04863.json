  "description": "The Commercial Pattern Archive database (CoPA) provides a unique tool for researchers and designers to recreate or date clothing from 1868 to 2000. The cornerstone of CoPA is the Betty Williams Collection. Betty Williams, a theatrical costumer in New York City, pioneered research on commercial patterns in the early 1980s. She became a leader in the field, establishing a major personal pattern collection and encouraging others to actively participate in the collection and storage of patterns. The Betty Williams collection is an extensive pattern collection now housed at the University of Rhode Island. The Williams Collection is combined with the URI and Joy Spanabel Emery Collections in the Commercial Pattern Archive in URI Library Special Collections. ** Please contact e-databases@library.nyu.edu for the password **",
