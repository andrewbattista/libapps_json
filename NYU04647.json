This was the first newspaper in China with a Chinese editorial staff. Containing more than 2 million articles, the database is 100% full-text searchable and contains the full-image of each page. Both the full-text and the full-image are retrieved in a single search, and full text may be easily copied from the full-image as well. In addition, each page of this archive has been painstakingly proofread, yielding a perfect text.",
