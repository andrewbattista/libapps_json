  "description": "The field of Medieval Studies explores European and Mediterranean civilization from the 4th to the 15th centuries. This period, which has a critical importance for the understanding of Western culture, can best be approached through a combination of several disciplines from history to English literature. As such, it is constantly responding to the emergence of new interpretations and ideas for scholars to consider.",
