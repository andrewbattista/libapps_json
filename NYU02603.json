  "description": "Currently contains 40 volumes, covering the fields of organometallics, hetarenes and related ring systems, compounds with four and three carbon-heteroatom bonds, compounds with two carbon-heteroatom bonds, compounds with one carbon-heteroatom bond (e.g. fluorine compounds, alcohols, ethers), all-carbon functions (e.g. cumulenes, allenes, polyynes, arynes, enynes, and alkynes). The electronic backfile (1909 to 2003) provides immediate access to 146,000 product specific experimental procedures, 580,000 structures, and 700,000 references in all fields of synthetic organic chemistry, dating back to the early 1800s.",
