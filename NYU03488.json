  "description": "This digital collection answers a need for clear, intelligible and informative English-language sources relating to China and the West, 1793-1980, which can be accessed online and used in the classroom or in course packs. It is also ideal for independent projects on almost any aspect of Chinese history during the two centuries of monumental social and political upheaval that ultimately recreated China into a modern power. With manuscripts encompassing events from the earliest English embassy to the birth and early years of the Peopleâ€™s Republic, students are given an incredible insight into the changes wrought upon China during this period.",
