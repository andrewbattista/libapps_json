  "description": "The study of music, “musicology,” is a relatively new discipline in academe, beginning in late nineteenth-century Germany. In the second half of the twentieth century, “ethnomusicology” became a viable academic discipline spawning a scholarly literature for the study of all musics not treated by traditional (“historical”) musicology.
