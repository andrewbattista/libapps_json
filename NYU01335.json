  "description": "Comprising hundreds of titles written during the 16th and 17th centuries, the DLCR will give researchers immediate, Web-based access to hundreds of hard-to-find works, including papal documents, synodal decrees, catechisms, confessors’ manuals, biblical commentaries, theological treatises, sacred drama, liturgical works, inquisitorial manuals, preaching guides, accounts of saints’ lives, and devotional works.... Through the DLCR, researchers will be able to analyze the works of well-known religious figures as well as an exhaustive sample of writings produced by the forgotten army of local scholars – both religious and lay – whose volumes collectively constitute the A to Z of Catholic reform.",
