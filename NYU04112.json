  "description": "Islamic Studies examines the range of lived experiences and textual traditions of Muslims as they are articulated in various countries and regions throughout the world. This interdisciplinary field combines history, religion, philosophy, anthropology, Arabic language and literature, as well as literatures in other languages including Persian, Turkish, and Urdu. Because the field includes so many areas of inquiry, the research is wide-reaching in its response to new discoveries, interpretations, ideologies and theories.",
