  "description": "Girolamo Savonarola (1452-1498) was among the first authors of the late 15th century to acknowledge the importance of printing as a means of propagating his ideas. Many regard him as one of Luther's predecessors. The rise of Florentine book illustrations is also closely linked with the dissemination of Savonarola's writings, since most contemporary editions feature at least one woodcut. This edition contains the complete incunabular section of the Stuttgart collection, offering over 200 incunables of interest to theologians, historians, art historians, and book historians.",
