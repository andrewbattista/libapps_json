  "description": "World Newsreels Online: 1929-1966, a streaming video product which captures full runs of many of the key international newsreels produced during the early twentieth century. These films, produced from 1929 right through to the early post-war period, provide a unique, and until now largely neglected, resource that will give scholars a real insight into how people learned about, and lived through the events that occurred during this period of history.",
