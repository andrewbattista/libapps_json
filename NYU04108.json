  "description": "As a discipline which examines crime as a social phenomenon, criminology is a constantly changing and expanding field. Because of its broad, interdisciplinary nature, a vast amount of scholarship and research already exists in addition to a regular influx of new research and material, and scholars and professionals must stay abreast of new discoveries, interpretations, and theories in the field. It is challenging for students, scholars, and professionals to stay abreast of the latest research and developments in the field.",
