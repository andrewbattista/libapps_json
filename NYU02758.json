  "description": "\"OneLook allows for easy, quick word searches in over 600 on-line dictionaries, including general, legal and foreign dictionaries, but a warning indicates that this type of search will take longer. Options are to search for English definitions only or to choose French, Spanish, Italian or German. The dictionaries range from something as well known as Merriam-Webster's WWWebster Dictionary to specialized resources like The Cadillac Performance Dictionary. The search results also contain links to the home page of the indexed dictionaries themselves if the user wants to further explore a particular resource. This site does indeed provide a great network of dictionary resources with 'one look'\"--\"Best Free Reference Web Sites 2000.\" RUSA Quarterly, Fall 2000; reviewed Mar. 6, 2000.",
