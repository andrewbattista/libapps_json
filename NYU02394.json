  "description": "The AWSS Translation Registry is a pilot project listing the translations and translations-in-progress into English of works by women authors of Eastern Europe and countries in the territory of the former Soviet Union. The Registry has two purposes: first to allow translators of such works to register a translation in progress so that other translators can avoid duplication; and second to let professors who are creating syllabi know what works by women writers of these countries are available in English.",
