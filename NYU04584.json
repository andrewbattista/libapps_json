  "description": "AdForum has been around since the late 90's and we are mainly a tool used by marketers to research ad agencies. Our clients are ad agencies as well as many award shows. Unlike a monitoring service, we are not recording advertising and putting it online. All of our content is managed and uploaded directly by our agency clients so we are getting what the professionals consider to be their \"latest and greatest\" work. We are getting 100-250 new ads weekly from around the world.",
