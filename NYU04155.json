  "description": "The Confidential Print series issued by the Foreign and Colonial Offices since c1820 originated out of a need for the Government to preserve all of the most important papers generated by the Foreign and Colonial Offices. Some of these were one page letters or telegrams â€“ others were large volumes or texts of treaties. In this resource one can review documents from the North American Confidential print series from 1824-1961.",
