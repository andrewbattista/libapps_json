  "description": "Includes interactive web-based databases and software to help the life-scientists understand the complexity of systems biology. Systems biology efforts focus on understanding cellular networks, protein interactions involved in cell signaling, mechanisms of cell survival and apoptosis leading to development or identification of drug candidates against a variety of diseases. In the post-genomic era, one of the major concerns for life-science researchers is the organization of gene/protein data. Protein Lounge has met this concern by organizing all necessary data about genes/proteins into one portal.",
