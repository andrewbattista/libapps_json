  "description": "Focus on the six research areas of the CASS Yearbooks: economy, education, environment, law, population and labor, and society. The new volumes will no longer be strictly organized on an annual basis. Rather, the selection of contributions will cover developments in China of particular interest to a Western (non-Chinese speaking) audience and will occasionally differ from the Chinese-language yearbooks. The volumes will continue to provide Western readers with firsthand insights into the discussions of Chinaâ€™s top scholars on contemporary issues in their country.",
