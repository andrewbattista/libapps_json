  "description": "Provides access to historic documents. This product illuminates the enduring conflict in American history between the need of society to protect basic freedoms and the equally legitimate need to protect itself from genuine threats to its security and existence. Organized alphabetically by organization, this collection covers a wide range of viewpoints on political, social, cultural, and economic issues. It sheds light on internal organization, personnel, and activities of some of the most prominent American radical groups and their movements to change American government and society. This collection supports a wide variety of courses in U.S. history, cultural studies, radical politics, and social movements. Source: Federal Bureau of Investigation Library. Dates: 1959-1971",
